# WebView

A tiny cross-platform webview library to create a common HTML5 UI abstraction layer frontend with your favorite programming language as the backend!

This library is written in C/C++ and has bindings for many others. See the sidebar for an API reference in each specific language.

It supports two-way JavaScript bindings (to call JavaScript from the backend-language and to call the backend-language from JavaScript).

It uses Cocoa/WebKit on macOS, gtk-webkit2 on Linux and Edge on Windows 10.

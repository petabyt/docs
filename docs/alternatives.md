# Alternatives to WebView

When it comes to creating a desktop app with a web frontend, there are many options  
outside WebView.

See an extensive list of Electron alternatives here: https://github.com/sudhakar3697/electron-alternatives

## Non HTML/CSS/JS Frameworks
Chances are, HTML/CSS/JS is not the right choice for your app, especially  
if it's a tool (designed to do one thing). Using HTML/CSS/JS as your frontend  
can be justified when your backend is smaller than your frontend.

- GTK ([also, my tutorial](https://petabyt.dev/blog/tiny-windows-linux-gtk-apps))
- [LCUI](https://github.com/lc-soft/LCUI)
- Qt
- ncurses

## Chrome/Chromium Rendering Backend
Using Chrome/Chromium as a web backend is very useful, since most people have it  
installed, and know how to install it.
